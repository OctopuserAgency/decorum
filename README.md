ES7 Decorator Validations
=========

Are you fed up with having to solve the simple but tedious problem of client-side/server-side JavaScript validations over and over again? Then this library is for you!

The ES7 Decorator Validations library gives you a quick, easy, declarative way of defining model validations on your JavaScript models without muddying up your HTML/JavaScript code with boilerplate validation code. 

It's main focus is around taking advantage of the ECMAScript 7 / ECMAScript 2016 [decorators proposal](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators) to provide a robust, reusable validation mechanism. Since browser support for ES7 decorators is not quite there yet, this library is meant to be used with an ES7 transpiler such as [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io/) or [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

**Note:** Despite being targeted for use with ES7 Decorators, you can still use this with ES5/ES6. Look further down for sample usage in ES5/ES6.
